# The Wonderful Front End Developer Challenge
The purpose of this challenge is to test and measure a frontend engineer's ability to interpret and implement a provided design. In this document, we will present you with a scenario that is intended to help showcase your engineering talents and spark creative thinking and problem solving. We will be watching both the journey and the final product.

## The Story
A major car brand is rolling out new models for the upcoming year, and have provided designs for a landing page that will showcase various trims and help the user locate the trims at dealerships in their vicinity.

The brand is very sensitive about the customer experience. It must feel fast and snappy, but cannot hold back on quality. The brand has asked us to "breathe life" into the design by adding an artful amount of interactivity and animation - but they have left the details to our best intuition. If we go too crazy, they will reject our ideas, but if we are too conservative they will begin to micromanage and "tinker" with the design (we don't want that, either).

They only provided a mock for the desktop breakpoint, but they expect that majority of their traffic to be on mobile devices.

## Expected Delivery
- a url to view your webpage
- a reviewable copy of the codebase

## Requirements
- Use the provided mocks and assets to create a single-page web experience. You will need to lean on your judgement, as the mock is intentionally vague as to how to handle things like empty states, UI interactions, and the like.
- Use the images provided in the `./assets` directory to create a slideshow.
- Use Google Maps to create a simple map that allows users to click various markers on the map to populate a dynamic sidebar with the trims available for each marker.
	- **Location 1:** A dealership in Brooklyn, NY has all three trims available
	- **Location 2:** A dealership in Queens, NY only has the LS and the LS HYBRID
	- **Location 3:** A dealership in Newark, NJ only has the LS F SPORT
	- **Location 4:** A dealership in Plainfield, NJ doesn't have any of the trims
- Use your best judgement as to how to implement a mobile breakpoint.
- Customers should be able to "Request a Quote" when they see a trim. For the sake of this web page, we will assume clicking that button tells an API to send an email. A different developer is building the API, and it isn't built yet, but you'll need to prepare for it.

## The Rules
- There is no time limit. You are done when you are satisfied - but the client is eager.
- You can use any resource or library that you think is *best for the product*. However, you must be able to justify and attribute any external resource.
- You can ask as many questions you need to anybody at Wonderful. We have been working with this client for many years and can provide answers or feedback, or validate any assumptions.

## You will be graded on:
- the resilience, strategy, and organization of your CSS
- the elegance, efficiency, and performance of any javascript
- your understanding of best HTML practices
- your creative intuition as to how to "fill in the gaps" that are missing within the design
- your development speed, compared to the quality of the delivered product
- how easy it would be for another developer to hop into the project and work with you
- our understanding of the quality of your development process

âœ¨ Thanks! Good luck!
